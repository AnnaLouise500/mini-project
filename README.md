# mini-project

## What does this project aim to achieve?
I want to be able to boost my online presence, whilst showcasing my existing and planned skillset, in the aim to expose myself to more 
work opportunities.

## Which technologies have been used?
I have used a mix of HTML, CSS and JavaScript within this project. This code comes from both the Bootstrap library and my adaptations 
on these.

## Which features do I plan on adding?
I want to make this site as fluid as possible to enable many different users exposure to my background and skillset. I plan to automate
as many processes as possible, e.g. uploading new content such as projects into my online portfolio. 
To do this I plan to:
### Create an upload form available on the site owners view
This is where the site owner can upload files, add a description and a title and then click upload to display new content in a uniform manner. 
This will keep maintenance needs to a minimum as all entries will use the same format. 
I also then do not have to go in and add extra code by hand each time I launch an update.
